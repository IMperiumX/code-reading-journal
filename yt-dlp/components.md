**Beyond the Core Components:**

1. **`InfoExtractor`: The Heart of Extraction**

   * `InfoExtractor` is the base class for all website-specific extractors. It defines common methods for fetching web pages, parsing HTML, and extracting video information.
   * **Code Snippet (from `YoutubeIE`):**

     ```python
     def _real_extract(self, url):
         # ... (Code to fetch webpage and extract video ID)

         video_details = self._call_api(
             'Player', video_id,
             # ... (API call parameters)
         )

         formats = self._parse_js_formats(
             video_details['streamingData']['formats'], video_id
         )
         # ... (Further processing and returning video information)
     ```

   * This snippet showcases how `YoutubeIE` interacts with YouTube's API to retrieve video details and formats.

2. **`Downloaders`: Managing the Download Process**

   * `Downloader` classes handle the actual downloading of video and audio streams.
   * **Visualization:**

     ```
     +-----------------+      +------------------+      +-------------------+
     | InfoExtractor   | ---> |  Downloader      | ---> | Postprocessor     |
     +-----------------+      +------------------+      +-------------------+
     | (Extracts info) |      | (Downloads data) |      | (Processes output) |
     +-----------------+      +------------------+      +-------------------+
     ```

3. **`Plugins`: Extending Functionality**

   * yt-dlp's plugin system allows developers to add support for new websites or modify existing behavior without altering the core codebase.
   * **Example:** A plugin could be created to integrate with a cloud storage service, automatically uploading downloaded videos.

4. **`utils.py`: A Treasure Trove of Helper Functions**

   * This module contains numerous utility functions used throughout yt-dlp, such as:
     * `determine_ext`: Detects file extensions based on MIME types or URL patterns.
     * `sanitize_filename`: Cleans up filenames to remove invalid characters.
     * `encodeFilename`: Encodes filenames to handle different character encodings.

**Interesting Patterns & Techniques:**

* **Object-Oriented Design:** yt-dlp extensively utilizes object-oriented principles, making the code modular and maintainable.
* **Regular Expression Mastery:**  The codebase showcases advanced usage of regular expressions for parsing complex website structures.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Handling:** yt-dlp uses the `argparse` module to create a flexible and user-friendly command-line interface.
* **Error Handling and Logging:**  Robust error handling mechanisms and detailed logging ensure that yt-dlp provides informative feedback to users.

**Deeper Dive into `YoutubeIE`:**

* **Age-Gating Bypass:**  `YoutubeIE` implements logic to bypass age restrictions on YouTube videos by extracting the necessary cookies or tokens.
* **Format Selection:** It handles the complex task of selecting the optimal video and audio formats based on user preferences and available options.
* **Live Stream Support:** `YoutubeIE` can extract and download live streams from YouTube, utilizing features like DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP).
